Unfortunately, I cannot refactor this code without additional information/context on how the code is being used or what specific C Standard Library features need to be emphasized. The code itself appears to be limited to specific system calls and typedefs, which make it difficult to determine how best to refactor it while still fulfilling its intended purpose.
